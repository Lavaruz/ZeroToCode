Express-Session = Serverside session
- only save sessionID
- session data live in database
- will be erased if server restarted
- not shared if we have clusters
- for secure data

Cookie-Session = Clientside session
- save session data instead of sessionID
- not require database
- stateless so free to use cluster
- need to be small
- data visible to the client
- not for secret data



Cookies = keep tracking are the user login? if wat to see the secret

cookies.keys == sign client cookies by the server
!! changing the cookies keys will invalidate all the session
!! is a good idea to have 2 cookies.key for our session
!! put cookies.key in dotenv
